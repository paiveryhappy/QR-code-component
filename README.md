FrontendMentor-QR code component-1 : This is my second time to do this again. 

I've just completed a front-end coding challenge from @frontendmentor! ðŸŽ‰

You can see my solution here: [https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/frontendmentorqr-code-component1-v-7vMLnr91](https://helpful-sable-11cfac.netlify.app/)

Any suggestions on how I can improve are welcome!
